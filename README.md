## datasets
use this to get the data from replog '''wget -O "datasets/k562.h5ad" "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35774440"''' 
(this gives in the normalised version)

wget -O "datasets/k562.h5ad" "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/35773219" 
(this gives the essential genes and raw version)
These are both 10GB+ files. 

All datasets used here are taken from: https://plus.figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Mapping_information-rich_genotype-phenotype_landscapes_with_genome-scale_Perturb-seq_Replogle_et_al_2022_processed_Perturb-seq_datasets/20029387
